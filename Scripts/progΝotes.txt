	Camera camera = Camera.main;
	float halfHeight = camera.orthographicSize;  //gives you the verical half-height of the camera in world units (the distance from the center of the view to the top)

	float halfWidth = camera.aspect * halfHeight;  //Multiplying that by the camera's width:height aspect ratio, camera.aspect, gives us our half-width in worldspace units.

	horizontalMax =  halfWidth;

====================================================

1) background move speed = neutral enemy move speed
 difficulty increases every x seconds aka background speed and neutral speed increases every x seconds
2) speed aka difficulty has thresholds like a flag example: speed = 4.25 <6 then difficulty = easy, if x>6 && x<12 medium x>12 DEATHFINITIVE
3) enemies reward more points based on difficulty level
4) not all enemies reward points though. Some might contact damage.

stationary enemy
	same speed as background
	MAYBE cannot be destroyed?
	Does not yield points

fast enemy
	Faster than background
	Can be destroyed
	Yields more points than slow enemy
	
slow enemy
	Slower than background
	Can be destroyed
	Yields less points than fast enemy
	Hardcap on how fast it can go


Lane 2
switching to backlane makes your scale smaller
switching to frontlane makes your scale normal

when player moves from back to front he regains his original scale
Up and down arrow used to transfer back and forth
when player presses up the GROUNDBOX moves...
when player presses down the GROUNDBOX MOVES YET AGAIN!!!

second spawner on backlane with smaller scaled enemies
2 lanes 2 layers

LANE 1 = GROUNDBOX original coordenates min height
x=1 y=-5.16 z=-202.3144

Lane 2 = GROUNDBOX coordenates aka max height
x= 1 y=-4.16 z=-202.3144

optimize and possibly fix vsync error with repeatbg

problems to solve 02/16/2021 FIXED
enemies trigger OnTriggerEnter2D all then time if they are from the UPPER lane. Which in turn makes them unable to hurt us, as they are already inside the checkzone. (if they player leaves and comes back somehow they damage the player, they work as intended though)
